### Project 001: Pinkbike Academy YouTube Comment Analysis
- The code is a Python script that retrieves and processes YouTube video data, including video IDs, comments, and sentiment analysis.
- It uses the requests library to make API requests to the YouTube API and retrieve video data.
- The data is processed and stored in Pandas DataFrames for analysis and manipulation.
- Sentiment analysis is performed by counting the frequency of words in the comments and filtering out common stopwords.
- The processed data is saved to a CSV file for further analysis via Tableau.
